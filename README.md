## Hi! i'm nic.
I am an Indonesian game developer with 6+ years of practical experience of making games in Unity, C#, and related tools for game development such as Audacity, Photoshop, Affinity, and Da Vinci Resolve. I’ve made 15+ games ranging from personal projects, professional works, and collaborative projects

//GAME PROGRAMMING
I’ve been developing games in the Unity engine since I was 11. Since then, I’ve gained more knowledge and
experience in using Unity, C#, and other tools in developing games such as Audacity, Photoshop, Affinity, Da Vinci Resolve, and many others! For Unity and C#, I’ve gained a deep, practical understanding in utilizing its tools such as animators, scriptable objects, timelines, audio mixers, and many others while also applying best practices such as object oriented programming, organizations, version control, and others.

//GAME DESIGN
Alongside programming, I’ve also grown an intuition in designing games. I have developed a diverse portfolio of games across multiple genres and platforms, ranging from atmospheric horror and hyper-casual mobile titles to desktop overlays and traditional board games. Developing these titles has taught me how to tailor unique design approaches based on a project’s core intent and its specific target audience.
